Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



Python3代码如下：
```python
def total1(limit):
    total = 0
    a = 0
    b = 1
    while b < limit:
        if b % 2 == 0:
            total += b
        c = a + b
        a = b
        b = c
    return total


def total2(limit):
    total = 0
    a = 0
    b = 1
    while a < limit:
        total += a
        c = a + b
        a = b + c
        b = a + c
    return total


print(total1(4000000))
print(total2(4000000))
```
