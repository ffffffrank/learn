## Largest palindrome product

### Problem 4

```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```



Python3代码如下：

```python
def reverse(n):
    ans = 0
    while n > 0:
        ans = ans * 10 + (n % 10)
        n //= 10
    return ans


def is_palindrome(n):
    return n == reverse(n)

max_palindrome = 0
for i in range(999, 100, -1):
    for j in range(999, i, -1):
        product = i * j
        if product > max_palindrome and is_palindrome(product):
            max_palindrome = product
print(max_palindrome)
```
